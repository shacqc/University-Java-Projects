## Nine Puzzle
A game of magic square written in Java. Conventionally, the purpose of the game is to arrange the numbers into numerical order from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. In order to slide a tile into an adjacent and empty slot, enter the number that corresponds to the tile.  There is no way to win the game; the numbers are arranged in such a way that no set of steps will reach a solution.

## PersonClassification
Allows entry of information regarding multiple people with an occupation of either singer or dancer. Said information is then outputed to the terminal to describe the person entered. This code implements the comparator interface to then display the same information but in order of age.
